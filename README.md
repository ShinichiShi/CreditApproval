## üìå Overview

This **Credit Approval System** is designed to assess loan applications by analyzing customer credit history, calculating dynamic credit scores, and making intelligent approval decisions. The system processes historical customer and loan data to provide real-time credit evaluations with appropriate interest rate corrections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Customer Management** - Register and manage customer profiles
- **Credit Scoring Algorithm** - Intelligent scoring based on payment history, loan volume, and current activity
- **Loan Eligibility Check** - Real-time eligibility assessment with interest rate corrections
- **Loan Processing** - Create and manage approved loans
- **Comprehensive Loan Views** - Individual and customer-wise loan details
- **Background Data Ingestion** - Automated processing of historical data
- **RESTful API Design** - Well-structured endpoints with proper error handling
- **Interactive API Documentation** - Swagger/OpenAPI integration
- **Dockerized Deployment** - Complete containerization with Docker Compose
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: [Django 4+](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Task Queue**: [Celery](https://celery.readthedocs.io/) with Redis for background processing
- **API Documentation**: [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/) via drf-spectacular
- **Containerization**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## üßÆ Credit Scoring Algorithm

The system implements a sophisticated credit scoring mechanism based on the following components:

### Scoring Components and calculations

1. Payment History (Up to 25 points)

        Formula: min(25, on_time_ratio * 25)
        Calculation: on_time_ratio = sum(emis_paid_on_time) / sum(tenure) for all existing loans.
        For new customers: Assigned 10 points as baseline

2. Loan Count Impact (Up to 20 points)

        Formula: `max(0, 20 - len(existing_loans) * 2)`
        Logic: Each existing loan reduces score by 2 points

3. Current Year Activity (Up to 20 points)

        Formula: `max(0, 20 - len(current_year_loans) * 5)`
        Logic: Each loan taken in current year reduces score by 5 points

4. Credit Utilization (Up to 20 points)

        Formula: `max(0, 20 - (total_loan_volume / approved_limit) * 20)`   
        Logic: Higher utilization of approved credit limit reduces score

### Approval Rules & Interest Rate Corrections

    Credit Score > 50: ‚úÖ Loan approved at requested interest rate

    30 < Credit Score ‚â§ 50: ‚ö†Ô∏è Loan approved with minimum 12% interest rate

    10 < Credit Score ‚â§ 30: ‚ö†Ô∏è Loan approved with minimum 16% interest rate

    Credit Score ‚â§ 10: ‚ùå Loan rejected

### Additional Safeguards

1. Credit Limit Breach:  If current_debt > approved_limit, credit score is set to 0 (automatic rejection)

2. Debt-to-Income Ratio Check

    Rule: (new_loan_emi + total_existing_emis) ‚â§ 50% of monthly_salary
    EMI Calculation:
    monthly_rate = `corrected_interest_rate / (12 * 100)`
    emi = `loan_amount * monthly_rate * ((1 + monthly_rate)^tenure) / (((1 + monthly_rate)^tenure) - 1)`


3. Interest Rate Correction Logic
    ```python
    if score <= 10:
        corrected_rate = 16  # Minimum for very low scores
    elif score <= 30:
        corrected_rate = max(requested_rate, 16)  # At least 16%
    elif score <= 50:
        corrected_rate = max(requested_rate, 12)  # At least 12%
    else:
        corrected_rate = requested_rate  # No correction needed
    ```
    The system implements a sophisticated credit scoring mechanism based on:
